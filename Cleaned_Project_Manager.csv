https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=e302af581ea70ba7,Front Range Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Project Manager,Full-time,,,,Trout Unlimited,4.4,Colorado,,"Description:
This is an exciting opportunity to join Trout Unlimited and use your talents to improve water quality and fisheries in Colorado watersheds impacted by historic hardrock mining. TU is hiring a self-motivated and competent person to facilitate and execute abandoned mine land reclamation and stream restoration projects in front-range watersheds across Colorado. This project manager will take projects from start to finish, developing project concepts, obtaining project funding, managing project implementation, and completing grant/funder reports.
TU started its Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Program in 2004 to address what the organization feels is one of the most important yet least addressed issues facing headwater streams in the West. In many ways, the state of Colorado has become the epicenter of our work, providing some of the highest-profile mine reclamation projects we have tackled to date. Colorado has also been in the public eye when it comes to AML issues with over 23,000 abandoned mine sites and the current push for Good Samaritan legislation to help facilitate point source cleanups. The combination of dramatic landscapes, ubiquitous legacy mining activity, and a populous state creates a well-suited setting to showcase our mine reclamation work.
The successful applicant will work with TU staff and stakeholders to secure additional funding for project activities and to cover core operational costs to sustain the program and this position in future years. This posting seeks to replace an existing project manager position, and this person will work closely with our existing AML team to accomplish projects primarily located in headwater reaches of the South Platte and Colorado River Watersheds.
The office location for this position is flexible, but the position requires travel throughout the state, particularly in Summit, Clear Creek, Gilpin, Park, Denver, and Boulder counties. The specific focus will be along and throughout the Front Range of Colorado, so the applicant must be close to those areas. Additionally, travel to occasional staff meetings and conferences outside the state will be necessary. The Front Range AML position requires a high frequency of in-state travel (>70%) during the field season, from May until October every year.
Requirements:
The primary job responsibility for this position will be managing and developing mine reclamation projects (including obtaining project funding and facilitating/overseeing project implementation) and coordinating with local and regional stakeholders to develop and execute those projects. The successful applicant will also be expected to collaborate with and support Colorado Trout Unlimited’s efforts and develop volunteer opportunities as appropriate.
Manage and coordinate abandoned mine land reclamation and construction projects of varying scope; oversee construction and verify design specifications during implementation.
Develop requests for proposals, evaluate proposals, and solicit contractor bids for projects with varying deliverables and budgets.
Coordinate and implement water and soil quality monitoring activities on TU-led projects and agency projects; interpret water/soil chemistry results to support decision-making regarding project success and future reclamation needs.
Manage engineering and/or outside consultants to complete necessary designs that meet project deliverables and can be implemented in the field.
Generate project funds through grant writing and provide regular updates to granting agencies through reports and invoicing.
Scientific writing of watershed-based plans, post-project reports, and concept papers.
Outreach and travel to TU functions and chapter meetings across the state.
Engage private landowners in project work and work with a broad group of project partners from local, state, and federal organizations.
Work closely with other TU staff and stakeholders to develop and implement reclamation projects.
Work with local/regional partners and TU staff to raise funds for program and project support, including identifying potential funding sources, drafting grant proposals, and developing relationships with funders.
Perform administrative duties, including contracting, grant reporting, invoicing, and budget management.
