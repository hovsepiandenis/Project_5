Work Where It’s Best for You
Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.
Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.
We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.
Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.
Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.
When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

Currently, we have built a collaborative AI agent called Postbot that helps users use natural language to automate key use cases in writing tests, visualizations of responses, and documentation. We know this work is valuable because Postbot has been highly adopted in these use cases but we also know we’ve just scratched the surface of the potential we have with AI to enrich the lives of millions of developers.
We are first going to more deeply integrate AI into these surface areas with key interaction patterns inspired by AI-first editors like Cursor, Copilot, and others. We need someone who deeply understands these interaction patterns that drive developer delight and how AI can be used to make the Postman developer experience faster and more efficient.
Join us, and help shape, build, and deliver the future of AI at Postman. We expect this role to not just be doing what you’re told, but to be actively exploring, learning, and proposing substantive improvements to our product experience and how AI fits in. Your opportunity is to embody the quote below by Alan Kay and help us invent the future.
“The best way to predict the future is to invent it”

Postman is helping developers and professionals across the globe build the API-first world by simplifying each step of the API lifecycle and streamlining collaboration—enabling users to create better APIs, faster.

Postman is privately held, with funding from Battery Ventures, BOND, Coatue, CRV, Insight Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Learn more at postman.com or connect with Postman on Twitter via @getpostman.
P.S: We highly recommend reading The ""API-First World"" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture and our vision at Postman.
What you’ll do
The team that builds Postbot is small, but mighty, so what you do day-over-day and week-over-week may vary and evolve as we continue to iterate in a fast-moving space in AI. This being said, we are looking for an engineer who is capable, curious, and motivated to shape and implement the integration strategy of AI to a mature, well-loved, and ubiquitous developer product in Postman.

You should expect to:
Own and deliver. Deliver improvements to the core product experience that help us achieve our goals around onboarding and activation
Innovate and experiment. Lead experiments with new AI-driven features, iterating quickly on prototypes to validate ideas and gather feedback, while keeping an eye on emerging trends and technologies in the AI space
More deeply integrate AI. Postbot is a useful experience right now, but to make it more useful, we need to integrate it in key surfaces like the script editor and documentation editor and establish best-in-class integration patterns in doing so
Own end-to-end workflows. Own end-to-end and understand core workflows, driving measurable improvements to user experience particularly focused on first-time user experience (sign-up, onboarding, and beyond)
Deeply understand the user. Collaborate and work with end users (developers!) using Postman to understand their core workflows and then use that knowledge to improve our product
Learn and grow. Broaden your knowledge of the core product and the domain over time, starting with Postbot’s integration strategy and in doing so expand to complete product knowledge and ability to make and influence changes across key products in the Postman user journey in API client, collections, and workspaces
Collaborate across boundaries and geographies. Collaborate on team processes to streamline collaboration across US and India team members
About you:
Must have:
MUST HAVE: Cloud and AI knowledge and awareness. AI, GenAI, Machine Learning and at least familiarity with one of the major clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure)
Depth and quality of experience is more important than number of years, but typically a good target is that you have at least 3+ years of experience with machine learning projects.
Expertise in building the modern web with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You likely have used libraries or frameworks like React or Next.js, but we care much more about the fundamentals than the tech stack.
Track record of delivering impactful and engaging user experiences that delight users.
Excellent communication skills. We’re a remote-first team and we’re going to be moving fast together. Good communication is key.
Detail oriented. We have to care about the details, and while we don’t expect you to be a designer, you need to care about the product experience that our teams are shipping.
Customer obsession. As we are a core product with years of muscle memory, we need an engineer who is able and willing to leverage the voice of the customer to expedite decision making, develop conviction, and most importantly delight our user.
Based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Nice-to-have:
Experience delivering AI-augmented features to established products
Experience with building or fine-tuning LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering
Experience working with or using full-stack JavaScript / TypeScript
Experience working in a React application
Experience working on B2B product and/or developer tools
Our values:
At Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency & honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product.

Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with 278 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.
The Role
Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service. Almost 270 million households across 190+ countries now subscribe to Netflix, enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films in a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen.

Among other functions, Open Connect provides highly available, worldwide infrastructure for content production, processing, and distribution across all Netflix productions and licensed content. A core aspect of this is serving entertainment in the form of streaming video on demand (SVOD) and ultra-low-latency interactive cloud gaming over the public Internet.

We are looking for a highly skilled software engineer with experience in designing, tuning, and implementing high-performance transport algorithms and TCP stacks for delivering SVOD content.

You intimately understand the impact of dynamic Internet paths on SVOD content delivery and the challenges of SVOD coexisting with interactive cloud gaming. You will help refine and improve our heuristics for congestion control, loss recovery, and packet pacing for TCP-based media streams; collaborate effectively with colleagues to design and deploy innovative ideas into production; provide rapid debugging of production transport stack issues; and work closely with server, client and data analytics colleagues to improve our lab-based and production (A/B) testing techniques for evaluating service performance.

In this role, you will have the opportunity to directly impact core and emerging areas of our business. We provide the freedom to execute, learn, and pivot, and the responsibility to be self-directed, collaborative, and insightful.
Qualifications:
Experience identifying and solving highly complex transport problems that are open-ended or ambiguous and result in significant business or technical impact.
Experience effectively collaborating cross-functionally at a senior level while leading, growing, and creating opportunities for colleagues to scale their own impact.
Extensive experience in designing, implementing, debugging, and deploying kernel-resident network stacks.
Deep understanding of strategies implemented in modern TCP and/or QUIC stacks for balancing network congestion, goodput, latency and reliability in support of SVOD applications.
Experience with the implications for SVOD transport streams of policers & shapers, bufferbloat, active/smart queue management, and highly variable path characteristics.
Experience using network lab environments for appropriately designed data networking experiments exploring large, multi-parameter test spaces. Experience using A/B testing methodologies for appropriately designed transport stack performance testing in production.
Experience with clearly and concisely articulating to colleagues the technical and business implications of data-driven design choices.
You will be successful in this role if you:
Have the ability to define and self-manage cross-functional projects fueled by ambiguous questions.
Are a self-starter, curious and not afraid to ask when in doubt.
Are a quick learner and excited about learning new technologies.
Advocate software craftsmanship, take pride in your work and enjoy taking full ownership of projects from conception to production.
Nice to have:
Experience with software development & debugging TCP in FreeBSD environments.
Experience with the challenges that arise when SVOD streams share network paths with cloud gaming streams and other low-latency/interactive services.
Experience with tcpdump/wireshark, python and R (or similar tools) for network traffic capture, test orchestration, post-capture analysis and presentation.
Experience partnering with remote engineering or product teams across multiple time zones.
Masters or Bachelors degree in a relevant science or engineering discipline.
Be sure to review our culture page to learn more about the unique Netflix culture and the opportunity to be part of our team.
Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $230,000 - $960,000.

The Leverage team is scaling OpenAI with OpenAI. We apply our latest models to real-world problems in order to assist with or automate work across the company—then share what we learn back to the broader product and research teams. We’ve built an ecosystem of automation products that’s applied everywhere from customer operations to workplace to engineering.

We love building products for folks sitting right next to us, and we take the time to add the little big touches that delight. Our goal is to prototype fast, then build for reliable long-term impact. We're constantly looking for the similarities and patterns in different types of work, and focus on building simple, generic patterns that we can apply across many domains.

About the Role
We’re looking for an engineer who’s passionate about blending product design with new tech and new paradigms. You’ll be at the forefront of creating interfaces that aren’t just functional but delightful, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with our models. We value engineers who are proactive, product-minded, and who can see the big picture while paying attention to the little details that define great products.
In this role, you will:
Rapidly prototype user experiences that push the envelope of what’s possible with AI.
Iterate quickly, turning ideas into tangible products.
Deliver high-quality, beautiful, joy-inducing interfaces that resonate with users.
Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, understanding their workflows and uncovering opportunities for transformative improvements.
You might thrive in this role if you:
4+ years of professional engineering experience (excluding internships) in relevant roles at tech and product-driven companies
Are highly skilled in TypeScript, React, and other web technologies, and aren’t afraid to explore corners of the web spec to get stuff done.
Have a strong interest in design — from typographic layout and interaction design to user story-led creation — and are comfortable with tools like Figma.
Have a startup-y background or love bringing products from concept to reality: the 0 1 phase.
Interested in applying AI to the real-world (even if you don’t have experience)
Thrive in dynamic environments where ambiguity is the norm and priorities can shift rapidly.
Take ownership of your projects, driving them independently from inception to launch, with a focus on making a real impact.

About the company
X is Alphabet’s moonshot factory. We are a diverse group of inventors and entrepreneurs who build and launch technologies that aim to improve the lives of millions, even billions, of people. Our goal: 10x impact on the world’s most intractable problems, not just 10% improvement. We approach projects that have the aspiration and riskiness of research with the speed and ambition of a startup.
The Team:
Moonshots run on rocket fuel. Sometimes that rocket fuel includes making the most of all that Alphabet has to offer and not reinventing the wheel. Other times it might mean intentionally breaking the mold and tapping into novel tools only available outside the Alphabet ecosystem. We're a team of software engineers that interface with teams from across the X project portfolio to solve their most critical software challenges.
The Role:
You will learn about X and our process for creating moonshots, as well as working with projects, at both early and late stages. During this process, we will jointly identify the right project to join full time.
As a member of the team, you have a deep passion for problem solving and experimentation. You will be responsible for embedding into project teams and working collaboratively to tackle their most pressing software engineering priorities.
This is an extremely dynamic role and requires high cross-functional communication, organization, and planning. The ideal candidate is a self-starter and has a track record of effectively operating in a dynamic loosely structured environment (e.g. startup, new product within Google). The candidate may work on multiple projects/investigations.
How you will make 10X Impact:
Architect, design, build, and document cloud-based software solutions. Your work will potentially touch all layers (API design, production deployment, monitoring & troubleshooting, compute performance evaluation, and scaling) and will entail designing solutions that will need to adapt to changing use cases, so the ability to build extensible and maintainable software is key.
Rapidly develop prototypes to evaluate feasibility
Work effectively across stakeholder groups to identify solutions that scale (e.g., project team, Google product teams, security, privacy).
Educate teams on trade-offs, cloud-specific challenges and spread knowledge of cloud tech and modern CI/CD practices. This includes job scheduling & orchestration, experience developing with containers & microservices, exposure to infrastructure like Kubernetes.
What you should have:
A fast learner and a code writing machine (preferably in multiple programming languages); a strong commitment to code quality.
Experience writing and maintaining infrastructure as code (terraform, or other)
Hands-on cloud experience, particularly with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). What’s important is that you’ve built cloud services before.
Familiarity with data-intensive architectures: storage platforms, databases, pipelines, infrastructure, etc.
Solid software engineering skills and passionate about SWE productivity
BS/MS in Computer Science, or equivalent field
Ability to work in a small team / rapid prototyping environment and deal with uncertainty and fluidity
It’d be great if you had these:
Experience developing experimental and production services using GCP and Github, including frequently-used tools and systems such as Cloud Spanner, Vertex AI, TensorFlow, Dataflow, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), GitHub Actions, and Terraform.
Experience with front-end development
Familiarity with data analytics / ML modeling
Experience working in a startup environment
Experience with Google-internal software tools, services, and frameworks

Role Number:200529625

Apple Silicon Engineering is seeking Hardware-minded Software engineers to build innovative tools to design the next generation of Apple’s world-leading systems-on-chip (SOCs) Apple’s multi-billion-transistor Ax SOCs are the brain of every iPhone and iPad. The Analog Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits connect them to the physical world via complex IPs such as SERDES for data communication, PLLs for clock generation, and sensors for measuring physical quantities. Modeling Software Engineers bring a unique and versatile combination of software and hardware expertise. On their way from the designer's mind to becoming a piece of silicon, circuits take form in software. You will develop those software-representations of future hardware, and then make them real. This includes both the circuits themselves, and the underlying tools to enable hundreds more designers. We use modern software design methodology and apply it to AMS Hardware design. If you've written software in modern, designer-centric languages then you understand how powerful and freeing it can be. And If you've designed circuits, you know how hard it can be. Think of the IC-design tool-stack by analogy: RTL is C code, Schematics and gates are assembly, and Layout is machine language. Most IC design happens at one of those three layers, and most modern software design happens at a higher, more productive level. Tools handle the boring stuff and free designers to express their ideas. This is an opportunity to build that layer for IC hardware, and then use it to make the world's best mobile silicon. Core responsibilities: Architect, develop and test software to capture the behavior and performance of AMS circuits. SOME INDICATORS THAT YOU'D LOVE THIS JOB: - You wish that designing circuits felt more like writing Python code - Passion for building software to represent complex physical systems - Avid usage of - or contributions to - open-source scientific computing software - especially packages for hardware design, signal processing, and/or data analysis - An open mind about trying new things. Especially new tools

Description

Work on a simulation platform connecting multiple simulators to design analog mixed-signal IPs Design and development of Scientific Software package/framework Develop custom hardware description libraries, frameworks, and/or languages Design digital, analog, and mixed-signal simulation software

Key Qualifications
Expert level in Python and/or C++
Expert in Object-oriented Software (OOP)
Knowledge of Database frontend and backend
Familiarity with simulation tools for analog, digital, and/ or mixed-signal circuits
Familiarity with popular digital design HDLs (Verilog and/or VHDL)
Understanding of specs and requirements for AMS circuits is a plus

Education & Experience

BSEE and preferred 10+ years of industry experience

Additional Requirements

Pay & Benefits
At Apple, base pay is one part of our total compensation package and is determined within a range. This provides the opportunity to progress as you grow and develop within a role. The base pay range for this role is between $175,800 and $312,200, and your base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location. Apple employees also have the opportunity to become an Apple shareholder through participation in Apple’s discretionary employee stock programs. Apple employees are eligible for discretionary restricted stock unit awards, and can purchase Apple stock at a discount if voluntarily participating in Apple’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. You’ll also receive benefits including: Comprehensive medical and dental coverage, retirement benefits, a range of discounted products and free services, and for formal education related to advancing your career at Apple, reimbursement for certain educational expenses - including tuition. Additionally, this role might be eligible for discretionary bonuses or commission payments as well as relocation. Learn more about Apple Benefits.
