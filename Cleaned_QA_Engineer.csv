Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.
We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).
We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

Work Where It’s Best for You
Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.
Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.
We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.
Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.
Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.
When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

You have a track record of finding needles in haystacks through creativity, intuition, patience, and sometimes a little luck. We ship a lot. Occasionally something should get a polish or a second pass before clients see it. We want to find those rare cases without searching the entire haystack.
You've learned complicated new tools or systems through experimentation and self-directed research. We lean on judgement and context over process and checklists, getting the full picture takes some triangulation.
You've proposed changes to a feature, tool, or product that went on to be implemented. You’ll work directly with our engineers throughout the QA process. Our engineers are capable, smart, and do great work. And when something needs attention, it's your feedback they work from.
You know SQL and have used some combination of Python, Django, and REST APIs. If you haven't directly worked with these, you've seen these up close and have probably used something similar.
You can see problems from diverse perspectives, including that of campaigners, developers, and members of the public. You’ve probably have experience as a technical writer, developer advocate, software developer, product manager, database manager, or similar.
