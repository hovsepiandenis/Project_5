HEALTH ADVOCACY SERVICES:
SCRRA offers you and your eligible dependents free health advocacy services through Health Advocate. You are entitled to unlimited calls with trained professionals who can help you navigate the healthcare and insurance systems.

RETIREMENT PLAN:
The SCRRA contracts with the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). You pay a 7.00 percent employee contribution and SCRRA pays an employer contribution, which varies each year. To be eligible for service retirement, you must be at least age 52 and have a minimum of five (5) years of CalPERS-credited service. Upon retirement you are entitled to a monthly retirement benefit based on your years of credited service, age, and average compensation during your last three (3) years of service (“final compensation”). The retirement formula for New Members is 2%@62, which means at age 62, you receive 2 percent of your final compensation for every year of service.

Upon separation from employment with less than 5 years of credited service, you may request a refund of your employee contributions only, including interest, and end your membership with CalPERS, or leave it in your account and retain your service credit should you decide to work for another CalPERS-covered agency. If you are vested upon separation but do not retire, you may leave your contributions in your account until retirement or elect a refund.

SOCIAL SECURITY:
You do not participate in Social Security except for Medicare. You will contribute 1.45 percent of your pay to cover the hospital insurance portion of Medicare.

Additional Medicare Hospital Insurance Tax: As of January 1, 2013, employees are required to pay an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax on earnings above $200,000 (for those who file an individual return) or $250,000 (for those who file a joint return). This additional hospital insurance tax is not reflected in the rate above.

RETIREE MEDICAL:
Unrepresented employees hired before 11/1/18*: You will be eligible for medical coverage when you retire if your separation date and retirement date are within 120 days of each other. SCRRA pays the same amount for retirees as it does for active employees, which is currently 87.5 percent of the applicable premium.

Unrepresented employees hired on or after 11/1/18: You will be eligible for medical coverage when you retire if your separation date and retirement date are within 120 days of each other and you have a minimum of 10 years of credited CalPERS service, five of which must be performed at SCRRA. SCRRA pays a percentage of the state annuitant contribution rate** in accordance with the vesting schedule below:

10 Years of CalPERS Service - 50%
11 – 19 Years of CalPERS Service - 50%, plus 5% for each additional year of service
20+ Years of CalPERS Service - 100%

Once each year the employer may allow unrepresented employees hired before 11/1/18 the opportunity to individually elect to be subject to the vesting schedule.

**The state annuitant contribution rates for 2023 are: $883 (Retiree Only); $1,699 (Retiree + 1 Dependent); $2,124 (Retiree + Family).

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (457) :
You are eligible to set aside a portion of your current income without paying taxes on that money until it is received later during retirement when taxes may be lower. In 2023, you can defer up to 100 percent of your gross compensation or $22,500 annually, whichever is less (“normal contribution limit”). You may make an additional $7,500 contribution to the plan if you are age 50 and older. If you are at least within three years of the age in which you are eligible to receive unreduced benefits under our CalPERS retirement plan, you may contribute up to double the normal contribution limit, or $45,000.

TRANSPORTATION PASSES:
You may use your employee badge for unlimited free access to all Metrolink lines and trains. Your badge cannot be used on connecting public transportation. However, if you commute to/from work on Metrolink on a regular basis and need to connect to other public transportation (e.g., Metro Red or Purple Line) you can be issued a Metrolink pass with the appropriate station pair, which will also give you access to connecting transportation.

You are also eligible to receive a free transit pass to ride any greater Los Angeles area transit system other than Metrolink (such as, Metro, Foothill Transit, LADOT, and LOSSAN) for commuting purposes. The commuter transit pass has a value up to the monthly maximum tax-free transit pass amount established by the Internal Revenue Service ($300 in 2023). You are responsible for any transit fares above the IRS monthly cap. To receive this benefit, the SCRRA requires each employee to use public transportation to commute to and from work three (3) or more days per week.
