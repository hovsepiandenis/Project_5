Here's what all the hype is about: Premier Nutrition Company (PNC) is one of the fastest-growing companies in the convenient nutrition space showing clear leadership in the category of protein shakes and protein powders. We make the brands Premier Protein, Dymatize, and PowerBar, which is sold internationally, and we are part of our holding company, BellRing Brands (NYSE: BRBR).

We have a simple, yet powerful, formula for our success, which we’ve been nailing for over 15 years. We start off with an organization powered by our company purpose—Changing Lives with Good Energy. Then our purpose-driven people are given the support and autonomy to develop and grow. Next, we are super-intentional about designing a culture where everyone feels like they truly connect and belong, which is one of our five company core values. Purpose-driven, connected employees who are consistently mastering new skills deliver amazing business results. And winning companies with amazing people and thriving cultures attract and retain top talent, so the cycle becomes self-reinforcing or what we call our regenerative culture.

We don’t mind sharing our formula since, as people who we believe in the power of changing lives with good energy, we think the world would be a better place if more workplaces treated adults like adults and gave them the platform to do the best work of their lives—alongside some truly amazing colleagues. Why don’t more companies do this? It takes deep-in-your-bones conviction to your people, products, and purpose to pull it off. It also takes resisting the urge to try to control people, and instead trusting them to make the right decisions. The results of our vibrant culture speaks for themselves: We were certified as a Great Place to Work™ for the 8th year-running in 2024. And we currently rank #2 on Fortune Magazine’s Best Workplaces in our category, and in the top 12 for each of the last 5 years.

We have a long list of ways we take care of our people, but here are some crowd-pleasers that our employees often say they love most: Year-round ½ day Fridays, in-office massages, free lunches & snacks, dogs in the office, month-long cultural and diversity celebrations, monthly over-the-top in-office events like bring your kids to work day, 6% 401k match after 1 year, as-needed sick leave, generous paid family leave regardless of gender, all positions bonus-eligible, company-wide volunteer days, company-matched charitable donations, no employee handbook, no dress code, coaching conversations instead of performance reviews, walking meetings, free exercise classes, and company-paid gym membership for Emeryville-based employees.

PNC seeks individuals who will flourish in this type of work environment and will add to our culture and help build this high-growth company for the next phase in our amazing journey. Does this sound like you? Then read on…#LI-hybrid
Responsibilities:
The role you’re interested in…
The Sr. Financial Analyst acts as a co-pilot to the Premier Nutrition Associate Director for Sales Finance. This role is integral in providing financial support to our sales organization

The work environment…

So, what’s it like to work here? If you’re based in the greater Bay Area, you’ll walk into our Emeryville office each Tuesday morning and start the in-person portion of our hybrid work week at our weekly all-company meeting and find close to 200 of your colleagues sitting on sofas, beanbag chairs, or the floor excitedly talking through the week ahead and watching a newer teammate tell their personal life and career journey followed by a quick update on any hot topics that might be relevant to the week ahead.

We are a dynamic, HYBRID workplace so every employee who lives within 100 miles of our offices is expected to come in each TUESDAY and WEDNESDAY. We aligned on those two common days way back in 2021 to be intentional about connecting in person for things like innovation, impromptu collaboration, having respectful challenges to get to better decisions, leadership role-modeling, and culture building. Great work cultures are built on stories about what great looks like in practice, and great stories on Zoom meetings are few and far between. The expected pay scale for this role is $105k to $115k, which may vary based on relevant experience, qualifications, geographic area (if applicable), and internal equity for the role.

Our modern 50,000 sq. foot headquarters straddles the border of the cities of Emeryville, Oakland, and Berkeley, California with free onsite parking and many transportation options.

Quick 30 min phone chat with a high energy member of our Talent Acquisition team to do a quick overview of your background and answer any burning questions you have
Team interviews are kept to a minimum to foster a more efficient, candidate-friendly process (too many interviewers yields little value and drags out the process for you—and who wants that, right?):
A short series of in-person or video interviews in a 1:1 setting; these are usually with the hiring manager, one or two other team members, and a person from another team to get broader perspectives (note: we don’t do panel interviews because they don’t give interviewers a chance to ask you unique questions, and we assign interviewers different roles so we’re probing different capabilities)
A case study or job task to simulate what you’d actually be doing in the role (since your job is not actually to be interviewed for a living, why is that the thing companies rely on so much?) Yes, there will be a small panel for this one so you don’t have to do it more than once, and yes, they might ask you some kind yet probing questions at the end after the raucous applause stops.
Once your interview concludes, the team will meet for an in-depth consultative process to ensure we are hiring the right person for the right job. Interviewers must come in with a strong yes or no vote beforehand to avoid groupthink with supporting reasons. The collective thoughts on your candidacy will be discussed in an environment of safety to challenge ideas respectfully, debate. and be open to all important qualifications of the candidates. A trained, disinterested bias blocker will be present to help mitigate bias so the team can make a sound hiring decision. The moment of truth arrives when the hiring manager makes the big decision. If you nailed the interviews and the case study was brilliant, guess what? The offer is all yours! And the ball is in your court. Will you accept? We sure hope so because this place is the real deal, and don’t just believe us—just ask the 93% of our people who said this is a great place to work in our most recent employee survey.
We strive to create an equitable and inclusive environment to contribute to the success of our organization.

WHO WE ARE
Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) is Oregon’s housing finance agency. We provide financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. Our vision is that all Oregonians can pursue prosperity and to live free from poverty. Across Oregon, housing has emerged as a paramount concern. The lack of available housing, high rents and high home prices are driving rapid increases in housing instability and homelessness. The data is clear: too many Oregonians are without a safe, stable, and affordable place to call home.
OHCS is placing a greater emphasis on strategic planning and the way we invest our resources. Recently, we have restructured, refocused, and reimagined our agency. Our work has led to an increased emphasis on data, research, and customer service. We are carrying that effort forward with the
Statewide Housing Plan
. The plan articulates the extent of Oregon's housing problem and what we can do to address it. OHCS committed to the Housing Stability Council and our stakeholders that the plan will be responsive to the needs of the state.
OHCS released its
Building Oregon's Future: 2023 Annual Report
to update the agency’s significant progress in meeting the goals outlined in the 2019 Statewide Housing Plan. We are now more than halfway into the five-year plan.

DISASTER RECOVERY & REILIANCE
The Oregon Department of Housing and Community Services (OHCS) has established a new division to manage recovery from major disasters. The Recovery & Resilience section will administer long-term state and federal grants to benefit disaster survivors and impacted communities in Oregon. Primarily, the division is recovering from the major disasters that occurred during Labor Day Weekend of 2020 when fires caused the loss of nearly 4,200 homes in the state. The Oregon Legislature allocated $150 million in specific wildfire recovery along with substantial affordable housing funding which will be applied to disaster impacted regions, and the federal government is expected to allocate resources to the recovery as well. OHCS has set aggressive goals to replace as much of the lost housing as it possibly can, and to provide a comprehensive recovery for individuals impacted by the fires. This division is a key function of OHCS and will develop innovative business practices within the agency through the administration of multiple CDBG-DR programs for recovery and resilience including HARP, HOP, IHA, PIER, and others. Under the CDBG-DR grant, DRR plans to carry out multiple Substantial Action Plan Amendments (SAPAs), which will likely result in significant program changes, the addition of new programs, and the development of updated and/or new policies and reporting requirements.
