Job Description
The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is charged with investigating, mediating, and prosecuting complaints that members of the public file against New York City police officers alleging the use of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, offensive language, untruthful statements made by officers, and racial profiling and biased policing. The Board consists of 15 members who are appointed by the Mayor, the City Council, and Public Advocate or designated by the police commissioner. The Board is responsible for governing the agency. The Executive Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the agency. As the largest police oversight agency in the United States, the CCRB currently investigates approximately 4,500 complaints each year.

In April 2021, the New York City Council passed Local Law 47, which clarified that the CCRB has the authority, under its abuse of authority jurisdiction, to investigate civilian complaints against New York City police officers alleging racial profiling and other forms of biased policing based on race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, immigration, or housing status.

To execute this newly clarified authority, the CCRB has created a Racial Profiling and Bias-Based Policing (RPBP) Investigations Unit. The RPBP Unit has built a team of skilled and experienced investigators, investigating attorneys, and data analysts to handle these biased policing investigations, which are often complex. The RPBP Unit’s investigations include quantitative analyses of various NYPD and New York City datasets to identify potential patterns of biased conduct. To help support this work, the RPBP Unit seeks a full-time Data Analyst. Reporting to the Chief Data Scientist of the Unit, the Data Analyst will help to design and conduct these analyses and report their results in a clear, comprehensible way to agency staff and CCRB Board members.

The Data Analyst’s responsibilities may include, but will not be limited to:

Compiling and cleaning various NYPD and New York City datasets
Analyzing officer-level, command-level, and department-wide NYPD datasets to identify potential patterns of biased police conduct
Explaining analyses and presenting findings clearly to non-technical audiences in writing and orally
Creating maps to aid investigations of civilian complaints
Working with RPBP Unit staff to identify and request necessary data from the NYPD and other entities
Reading and summarizing academic papers and/or government reports related to policing in New York City
Assisting the Chief Data Scientist, Director, and Deputy Director of the RPBP Unit with the drafting and publication of reports on racial profiling and biased policing

About the City of Baltimore, Mayor’s Office of Employment Development:
The Mayor’s Office of Employment Development (MOED) coordinates and directs workforce development initiatives responsive to the needs of Baltimore City employees and job seekers to enhance and promote the local economy. At MOED, we view our mission broadly to deliver economic justice to our city! To us, economic justice means creating an equitable workforce system for all residents – especially those who have been generationally and systemically disadvantaged – one that is responsive to their needs and ensures viable economic opportunities. Our vision is for every City resident to maximize his/her career potential and for all employers to have the human resources to grow and prosper – a workforce system that works.
POSITION OVERVIEW
This Disaster Recovery Dislocated Worker grant-supported position is funded by the Port of Baltimore Dislocated Worker grant allocation, with funding available through 2026. MOED’s programs will serve residents citywide and prioritize disadvantaged workers, who are among the 8,000 workers impacted by the Key Bridge collapse and closure of the Port of Baltimore. An estimated 60% of them are residents of Baltimore City. In the three days immediately following the collapse, over 400 new unemployment claims were filed, and over 1,000 more people called for information about filing unemployment claims. While additional data is pending, it seems clear that unemployment claims will continue to increase and impacts from the collapse to ripple out into the community. These funds will provide case management, barrier removal, supportive services, and skills training to workers dislocated by the disaster, as well as offer occupational skills training to prepare workers to assist with disaster recovery efforts and, eventually, the reconstruction of the bridge.
The Data Analyst will play a crucial role in the recovery process, developing and managing a comprehensive data collection, auditing, and reporting scheme for a workforce program to support individuals impacted by the Key Bridge collapse. This role involves designing and implementing data systems from the ground up, utilizing SQL to extract data from agency systems, and applying PowerBI for data analysis and visualization.

Additionally, the candidate should be detail-oriented, capable of monitoring data integrity, and experienced in efficiently handling internal and external data requests. Familiarity with Microsoft 365 tools and understanding labor market statistics would also be beneficial.
